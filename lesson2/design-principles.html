        It is very clear that they want you to know about the sale. It is clearly the most important thing on the page, being the boldest and biggest element. Then they give you an easy way to select your category. I think visual hierarchy is almost instinctive: you make the most important things are the ‘biggest' to you, and that translates to the page.

        I think this shows Hicks Law really well because it gives you simplistic and limited options. You should be able to make a quick decision and they guide you to options that benefit their business. I think it is an awesome example.

        I think apple could be the poster child for sleek, clean design. I don’t necessarily prefer their products to android (I use both) but they are the masters of white space (or in this case, black space) and clean design. It is very minimalist and draws your focus to what is important.
