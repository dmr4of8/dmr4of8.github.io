    <h1>Target Audience</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Back to Index</a>
    <p>The target audience for this site will be anyone looking to go outside 
        that day or heading somewhere on vacation wanting to check the weather, so they prepare appropriately. 
        It can also be used by people planning their outdoor housework wanting to know if the weather will say nice.</p>
    <p>Persona 1: This is someone who is packing to leave for a vacation and wants to know what clothes to pack.
         Should they pack shorts? Pants? Winter parka? They would come to this site and enter a location. 
         This would display the weather and a forecast for them so that they can see what the weather is predicted to be.
          This will help them know how to pack. Their expectation will be that they can easily look up the weather for a location and 
          find the highs and lows that are expected, as well as if it is going to rain or snow. They don’t want to be inundated with popups and ads. 
          They also don’t want an hourly forecast because they want to see the weather for days, sometimes weeks ahead.</p>
    <p>Persona 2: This is someone who is going to go out and work in their yard. 
        They want to have the weather for their location. 
        They don’t really want to see what the weather will be like a week from now because they want to work in their yard today. 
        They want to see an hourly forecast and see if it is going to rain or be sunny when they are working the yard. </p>
